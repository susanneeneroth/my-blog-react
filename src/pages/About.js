            <p>I am studying Front End Development at Medieinstitutet 2020-2022, and this is a personal learning project in React. My aim is to learn as much as possible about ReactJS by building a blog page with different functions.</p>

            <p>So far I have used json server to be able to use a local database with fetch, included a function to add blogs and delete blogs to and from the database file, which is save as a .db file in the projects directory.</p>
            
            <p>I am also using Git Kraken together with Git Hub to be able to do backups to a repository on Git Hub. I work in a dev branch until I am finished with the project. I have not created feature branches so far, since I am the only one working on the project, but I might try it just to get exercise in it later on.
